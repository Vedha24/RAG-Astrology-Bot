Each sign has unique characteristics, elements, ruling planets, and symbols.",

        "how_it_works": "Astrology operates on the principle that the positions of celestial bodies at the time of a person's birth (or a specific event) can influence their personality, destiny, and the flow of events. This is interpreted through various systems, including zodiac signs, planetary aspects, and houses."
